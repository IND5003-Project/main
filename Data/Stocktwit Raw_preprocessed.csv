Im a big fan but the reviews since the Apple Event last week have not been kind. The biggest knocks against the announcement have been the lack of shows available on Apple TV+ (only so far and only one new one per month starting in November) and no new MacBook (not even anything MacBook related). In fact I think the most stories written were about what wasnt included in the announcement and whats coming in the iPhone. None of this bodes well for the stock price going into the final quarter of the year. ??????,"Sep 15th, 3:45 am"

"Much has been said about the 'great rotation' of momentum into value stocks in the past few days. Indeed, in the last two weeks, the Russell small cap index has seen the largest monthly inflows since , sending the index up . in the latest week. Meanwhile, momentum stocks, as evidenced by the momentum etf, fell . . While some see that as a rotation, others see it as a sign of strong stock market strength, as small caps are 'catching up' to momentum leaders. So Russell's rise is not necessarily due to selling the growth stocks, (altho they are being sold) but rather a broadening out of breadth, as the advance decline line for SP hits new highs. The percent of stocks above their DMA on the SP went from in August to as of , indicating most stocks are participating in the rally. Nasdaq's percent of stocks above their DMA went from in August to as of Friday. Similarly bullish for the tech stocks. ","Sep 14th, 8:53 pm"

Isnt funny announced a neutral rating and drop their target price at the same exact time aapl was hitting the top of the rising wedge? It was on purpose and planned. Thats the truth.

Qualcomm is still on its first generation G modem, and companies like Samsung are making headway of their own. But a multirung strategy that factors in low , mid , and high band spectrum is crucial to making G connectivity feel whole, and none of the devices on the market currently will be able to meet that vision when the carriers pursuing it are ready. By next September, Qualcomm will almost certainly have introduced a more capable and future proofed G modem that will better unlock all the potential we keep hearing about.

With the new Apple card and companies like SoFi, Lending Club, and new ones entering the industry, it makes me wonder how are they not worried of the potential collapse of consumer credit? So far I understand that these companies that buy up consumer credit just sell the junk accounts for peanuts to collections agencies and the current high interest rates compensate the losses but to me this does not seem like it plays out well in the long term. How are a lot of these companies not headed towards the same fate as WaMu when consumers start to default on their credit cards? If we really wanted a hard reset to the economy (seeing as though we cannot trust financial institutions to do the right thing) couldn't we technically start a movement where we all stop paying our credit cards all at the same time?
