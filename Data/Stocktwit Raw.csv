From CNBC:

“After rallying nearly 40% this year, Apple could be on the verge of a major breakout. Piper Jaffray chief market technician Craig Johnson says the foundation for another massive move higher is forming.

“Over the last couple years, this has been a pretty big consolidation pattern that has been forming, and that’s typically a bullish type setup here in the charts. From my perspective, it looks like the stock is setting itself up for another leg higher,” Johnson said Friday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.”

cnbc.com/2019/09/16/iphone-... 
 
    Leading Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says demand for new iPhones is beating his expectations — and much of it is due to Chinese consumers. 
 
    Kuo says the iPhone 11 Pro is more popular in the U.S. while China prefers the lower-priced iPhone 11. 
 
    Preorders for the phones started last week, they arrive in stores Friday.

Lach14,https://stocktwits.com/Lach14,https://avatars.stocktwits.com/production/252342/large-1388517644.png,"Much has been said about the 'great rotation' of momentum into value stocks in the past few days.  Indeed, in the last two weeks, the Russell 2000 small cap index has seen the largest monthly inflows  since 2016, sending the index up 6.5% in the latest week.  Meanwhile, momentum stocks, as evidenced by the $MTUM momentum etf, fell 2.5%.

While some see that as a rotation, others see it as a sign of strong stock market strength, as small caps are 'catching up' to momentum leaders.

So Russell's rise is not necessarily due to selling the growth stocks, (altho they are being sold) but rather a broadening out of breadth, as the advance decline line for SP500 hits new highs.  

The percent of stocks above their 50 DMA on the SP500 went from 28% in August to 71% as of 9/13/19, indicating most stocks are participating in the rally.  

Nasdaq's percent of stocks above their 50 DMA went from 25% in August to 65% as of Friday.  Similarly bullish for the tech stocks.

“Earlier: Goldman Sachs raised a red flag around Apple saying Apple TV+ was going to have a ""material negative impact"" on the company's financials. 

Apple then issued a statement saying Apple TV+ would not have a material impact on financials.

It's rare for Apple to push back against a particular sell-side report. Apple investor relations was likely worried this story had some legs and could potentially lead to other analysts publishing on the topic.

Taking a closer look at this topic, Goldman's call was somewhat obtuse in that the analyst was basically arguing messy accounting related to Apple TV+ should lead to a valuation cut.

Meanwhile, Apple's statement is basically saying that the various financial ins and outs associated with the Apple TV+ promotion will cancel each other out so that the overall impact on Apple's financial results won't be material...” 1/2",$AAPL,"Sep 13th, 11:25 pm",,3,Bullish,3

This years focus was the camera. Next year, hopefully new charging. 

Now, if the agreement is if they are paid based on each unit sold, then that changes the game as that would not be reflected in revenue yet. However, we are not approved yet in China or Japan. Does anyone have any info on when iPhone 11 gets released over there? I guess this doesn’t matter since the feature could be disabled until approved.

I blew the play yesterday and took 18.6% missing out on the 500% (I sold at $51 it went to $3.50 at open with plenty of volume). That because I didn’t see this until today. As you can see, the rising wedge is a great way to see the possible outcomes. The green lines is what it will do on the future, and the blue arrows show you all the tops.

Goldman cuts Apple on TV+ trial 
 
    Goldman Sachs cuts its Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) target from $187 to $165 and maintains a Neutral rating. 
    Analyst Rod Hall says the plan to offer a trial period for Apple TV+ is ""likely to have a material negative impact"" on ASPs and EPS. 
    Apple will offer one free year of TV+ with the purchase of certain types of hardware. Hall expects Apple to account for the trial as a $60 discount to the hardware/services bundle.

Bearish on AppleEvent: relativly boring stuff, no magic or thrill in there. Last real WOW products were the iPhone X, the AirPods and the ECG function in the Watch 4. 

But bullish on the stock. „something with streaming“ and „something with gaming subscriptions“ works very well on stockmarket in these days. 
And faboy scene and fanboy analysts like Neil Cybart do what they always do: beeing far reaching influencers. And that also spills over to the analysts. 

They were offended for almost 2 years (kind of narzism) because Tim Cook had ""taken away"" the Iphone sales figures as their top key figure.

But a multirung strategy that factors in low-, mid-, and high-band spectrum is crucial to making 5G connectivity feel whole, and none of the devices on the market currently will be able to meet that vision when the carriers pursuing it are ready.

With the new Apple card and companies like SoFi, Lending Club, and new ones entering the industry, it makes me wonder how are they not worried of the potential collapse of consumer credit? 
 
So far I understand that these companies that buy up consumer credit just sell the junk accounts for peanuts to collections agencies and the current high interest rates compensate the losses but to me this does not seem like it plays out well in the long term. 
 
How are a lot of these companies not headed towards the same fate as WaMu when consumers start to default on their credit cards? If we really wanted a hard reset to the economy (seeing as though we cannot trust financial institutions to do the right thing) couldn't we technically start a movement where we all stop paying our credit cards all at the same time?

Much like Apple Watch and Apple CarPlay the Apple Glasses will interact and interplay with full apps on the iPhone. There is likely to be an Apple U1 Chip built-in to the Apple Glasses as well as new Siri chips and Bone Conduction sound chip Apple has been working on. The Apple U1 Chip on the Apple Glasses and on the iPhone will work together as node anchors.""
